    <h1>Welcome to the DremJS Market!</h1>

    <h2>Collection.JS</h2>
    <p>A collection of JS apps such as emulators and applications. A sort of bundle app you could say!</p>
    <p>Provided by SparrOSDeveloperTeam</p>

    <h2>Bellard JSLinux</h2>
    <p>Our computers can't seem to understand how to use the make command so we made an app that connects directly to the demo website. You can connect your VFsync account to most of the OSes on this site to save your files, so you don't lose everything due to going to the home screen.</p>
